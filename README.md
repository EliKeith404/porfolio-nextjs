## Things Learned 🔖

The power and convienience of Next.js coupled with TailwindCSS allowed me to focus on building the site without having to jump back and forth between files to manage routes or styles.

This was my first project using a CMS and it was the perfect solution to update my project portfolio without having to redeploy the entire site. Before this, I was reusing the same code for my project pages which I knew wasn't ideal. I wanted to map through all of my projects and use variables to fill the details. Contentful's Space API was exactly what I needed and was easy to implement while maintaining Next.js static generation.
